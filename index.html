          <h3 class="section-title">Here's a time line of Aleister Crowley</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Youth: 1875–1894</b> - Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal
              Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.</li>
            <li><b>Cambridge University: 1895–1898</b> - Having adopted the name of Aleister over Edward, in October 1895
              Crowley began a three-year course at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was entered for the Moral Science
              Tripos studying philosophy. </li>
            <li><b>The Golden Dawn: 1898–99</b> - In August 1898, Crowley was in Zermatt, Switzerland, where he met the
              chemist Julian L. Baker, and the two began discussing their common interest in alchemy. </li>
            <li><b>Mexico, India, Paris, and marriage: 1900–1903</b> - In 1900, Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United
              States, settling in Mexico City and starting a relationship with a local woman. Developing a love of the
              country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with John Dee's Enochian invocations. </li>
            <li><b>Egypt and The Book of the Law: 1904</b> - In February 1904, Crowley and Rose arrived in Cairo. Claiming
              to be a prince and princess, they rented an apartment in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking
              ancient Egyptian deities, while studying Islamic mysticism and Arabic. </li>
            <li><b>Kanchenjunga and China: 1905–06</b> - Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had
              begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down. </li>
            <li><b>The A∴A∴ and The Holy Books of Thelema: 1907–1909</b> - With his old mentor George Cecil Jones, Crowley
              continued performing the Abramelin rituals at the Ashdown Park Hotel in Coulsdon, Surrey. Crowley claimed that
              in doing so he attained samadhi, or union with Godhead, thereby marking a turning point in his life. </li>
            <li><b>Algeria and the Rites of Eleusis: 1909–1911</b> - In November 1909, Crowley and Neuburg travelled to
              Algeria, touring the desert from El Arba to Aumale, Bou Saâda, and then Dā'leh Addin, with Crowley reciting
              the Quran on a daily basis. During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of Enochian magic,
              with Neuburg recording the results, later published in The Equinox as The Vision and the Voice. </li>
            <li><b>Ordo Templi Orientis and the Paris Working: 1912–1914</b> - In early 1912, Crowley published The Book of
              Lies, a work of mysticism that biographer Lawrence Sutin described as "his greatest success in merging his
              talents as poet, scholar, and magus". </li>
            <li><b>United States: 1914–1919</b> - By 1914, Crowley was living a hand-to-mouth existence, relying largely on
              donations from A∴A∴ members and dues payments made to O.T.O. In May, he transferred ownership of
              Boleskine House to the MMM for financial reasons, and in July he went mountaineering in the Swiss Alps.
              During this time the First World War broke out. </li>
            <li><b>Abbey of Thelema: 1920–1923</b> - Now destitute and back in London, Crowley came under attack from the
              tabloid John Bull, which labelled him traitorous "scum" for his work with the German war effort; several
              friends aware of his intelligence work urged him to sue, but he decided not to. When he was suffering
              from asthma, a doctor prescribed him heroin, to which he soon became addicted. In January 1920, he moved
              to Paris, renting a house in Fontainebleau with Leah Hirsig; they were soon joined in a ménage à trois by
              Ninette Shumway, and also (in living arrangement) by Leah's newborn daughter Anne "Poupée" Leah. </li>
            <li><b>Death On 1 December 1947</b> - Crowley died at Netherwood of chronic bronchitis aggravated by pleurisy
              and myocardial degeneration, aged 72. His funeral was held at a Brighton crematorium on 5 December; about
              a dozen people attended, and Louis Wilkinson read excerpts from the Gnostic Mass, The Book of the Law, and
              "Hymn to Pan". The funeral generated press controversy, and was labelled a Black Mass by the tabloids.
              Crowley's body was cremated, his ashes were sent to Karl Germer in the US, who buried them in his garden in
              Hampton, New Jersey. </li>
